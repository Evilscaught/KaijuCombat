Use the photoshop template file to create your card. Add the necessary components using layers, then export to PNG. 
Text layers have already been defined & formatted and simply need to be substituted with the information pertaining to your newly created card. 
Make sure to save-as all your new cards in a seperate folder and to keep the modified photoshop file.
